## Which services does it use?

Diffuse uses two layers of services, these layers are:

1. User layer
2. Music layer


### User layer

This layer will use a service to store data from a user, such as the user's favourites, their playlists and data from the processed music files.

You can choose between these services:

- [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/)
- [RemoteStorage](remotestorage.io)
- [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) <small>(ie. anonymous mode)</small>


### Music layer

This layer connects with the services the user has on which music can be found. No data is written to these services. You can combine all of the following services:

- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/)
- [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/)
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
- Local Filesystem <small>(native only)</small>
- [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) <small>(native only)</small>



## How does it work?

Diffuse locates all the music files on the given services, extracts the metadata and then stores it via the user layer (which was explained before).


### Supported File Formats

- MP3
- MP4/M4A

### CORS

There's only one thing you need to do yourself so that your service will work with the application, and that's setting up [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Here are the instructions you'll need for each service:

#### Amazon S3

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <MaxAgeSeconds>31536000</MaxAgeSeconds>
    <ExposeHeader>Accept-Ranges</ExposeHeader>
    <ExposeHeader>Content-Encoding</ExposeHeader>
    <ExposeHeader>Content-Length</ExposeHeader>
    <ExposeHeader>Content-Range</ExposeHeader>
    <AllowedHeader>If-Modified-Since</AllowedHeader>
    <AllowedHeader>Origin</AllowedHeader>
    <AllowedHeader>Range</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

#### Dropbox

_Not necessary._

#### Locally

_Not necessary._

#### IPFS

```shell
ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '["*"]'
ipfs config --json Gateway.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '["*"]'
ipfs config --json Gateway.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Headers '["X-Requested-With", "Range", "Content-Range"]'
```

#### Microsoft Azure Storage

```xml
<Cors>
  <CorsRule>
    <AllowedOrigins>*</AllowedOrigins>
    <AllowedMethods>HEAD,GET</AllowedMethods>
    <AllowedHeaders>If-Modified-Since,Origin,Range</AllowedHeaders>
    <ExposedHeaders>Accept-Ranges,Content-Encoding,Content-Length,Content-Range</ExposedHeaders>
</CorsRule>
<Cors>
```

#### WebDAV

### UI

The user interface should be self explanatory, but there are a few "hidden" features:

- You can select multiple tracks using the SHIFT key and then add that selection
  to the queue or a playlist by right clicking on the selection (desktop only).
- You can reorder playlist tracks with drag-and-drop.

### Search

Searching is powered by [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/), which means you can use all [these wildcards](https://lunrjs.com/guides/searching.html) and other stuff to refine your search. A few examples:

```elm
# "Parkway Drive" or "Iron Maiden".
# The non-escaped space (ie. ` `, not `\ `) indicates a new term.
Parkway\ Drive Iron\ Maiden

# Show me every track of which the artist's name starts with 'park'.
artist:park*

# Show me every track from Parkway Drive's "Deep Blue" album.
artist:Parkway\ Drive + album:Deep\ Blue

# Show me every track from Parkway Drive but not their "Atlas" album.
artist:Parkway\ Drive - album:Atlas
```
