## Q&A


__Why don't you support WebDAV on the web version?__  
Most WebDAV servers aren't built according to the [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) specification.
Which is a must-have for the web version, otherwise it doesn't work.
The WebDAV version was built with [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/) in mind.
